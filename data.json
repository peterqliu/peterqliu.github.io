This let us communicate frequency and severity simultaneously, without toggling between modes. The map also transitions smoothly to satellite imagery at higher zoom levels, to better portray any structures and inhabitants in the affected area.",
						"This was also one of the few maps where we shifted the longitudinal center away from the prime meridian, to better frame the clusters of quakes around the Pacific's Ring of Fire."

						"Mapbox GL added an extrusion feature to render buildings in 3D. Because 3D often gets in the way more than it helps, we wanted to use it in a way that was actually more illuminating.",
						"A U.S. Census dataset gave us the opening to use this feature in a way that was truly helpful. Typically, population data is typically presented in two ways: a raw count in each region, and in density of people per unit of area.",
						"But by using each city block as a cross section, and extruding it up to a height correlated to its density, the shape's volume naturally represents the raw count. This enabled us to communicate both statistics simultaneously, in the same visual encoding."

						"Our bounty of tools enabled us to go beyond the typical bikeshare application, to a full-fledged route planner. Once the user drags the markers for their desired trip, Turf identifies the nearest bikeshare stations to both endpoints. ",
						"Mapbox Directions then navigates the route in three segments: walking directions to the first station, biking directions to the second station, and walking directions again to the final destination.",
						"The demo also makes use of Surface API -- by sampling the elevation at regular intervals along the route line, we can generate a profile of the hills and slopes to expect as we pedal."

As new parcels continuously appear, each courier would target  as their prioritization scheme the oldest and closest parcel for their next pickup.",
