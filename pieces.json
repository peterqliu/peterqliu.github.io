Like with the courier demo, the use case of food delivery here turned out to be both very understandable and fitting: food delivery drivers needed to minimize drive times between restaurants and customers, but also must pick up the food before delivering it. We set up three different restaurants, each with their own dropoff points, and the user interactivity to show off the complexity of the problem and how quickly the API solves it in real time."

On top of a cool sport, there was some great tech behind the scenes: GPS trackers linked through iridium satellites, ocean telemetry that provided speed and height of waves throughout the bay. After collecting live race data on the day of, we built this replay interface to show how the race went. Also fortuitous was the new Mapbox heatmap functionality, which made for a compelling visualization of the water conditions."

				"blurb":"As Mapbox built a suite of tools around location and logistics -- navigation, geocoding, spatial analysis -- we wanted to tell a compelling story illustrating how these pieces could fit together. We simulated a fictional courier service in Manhattan, where cyclists collected parcels throughout the city, carrying up to five before unloading at one of three dropoff points. As new parcels continuously appear, each courier would target  as their prioritization scheme the oldest and closest parcel for their next pickup. Though entirely a simulation, this demo has all the makings of a real logistics service inside the browser: collecting an influx of pickup addresses, reverse geocoding to convert them to coordinates, Turf.js to measure distances and assign each courier their next pickup, and cycling directions to navigate the courier there."
