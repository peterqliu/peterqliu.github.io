						"As Mapbox built a suite of tools around location and logistics -- navigation, geocoding, spatial analysis -- we wanted to build a compelling use case illustrating how these pieces could fit together. ",
						"We simulated a fictional courier service in Manhattan, where cyclists collected parcels throughout the city, carrying up to five before unloading at one of three dropoff points. As new parcels continuously appear, each courier would target  as their prioritization scheme the oldest and closest parcel for their next pickup.",
						"Though entirely a simulation, this demo has all the makings of a real logistics service inside the browser: collecting an influx of pickup addresses, reverse geocoding to convert them to coordinates, Turf.js to measure distances and assign each courier their next pickup, and cycling directions to navigate the courier there."

						"Mapbox's Optimization API solves this, <i>plus</i> the option to specify that certain points must come before others. This became an incredibly nuanced, technical tool in search of a good explanation.",
						"For us, that surfaced in food delivery service. The user clicks and drags orders from three restaurants around Chicago, which a delivery driver fulfills. Each order must involve a pickup trip to the restaurant before heading to the customer, forming a complex queue that the algorithm handles in real time."

We did this by applying a series of animations, deformations, and color processes, to a recursively nested structure of shapes and systems. Introducing slight variations in each parameter produces a diverse set of pieces.",
						"Doing this performantly involves in GLSL shaders, which requires devising a higher-order framework of parameters that can encompass the full range of permutations and combinatorials.",

						"Visualizing complex systems usually takes two angles: a broad system schematic explaining how components 'generally behave,' but devoid of concrete or real-time examples. Or a display of those specific, tangible elements, but without inferring broader trends and patterns of how they work together.",
						"This was an attempt to do both, with city transit. Beginning with that low-level view of individual vehicles, the user interacts with them to see the paths, stops, and predictions of each route. Progressive disclosure keeps the information manageable at each juncture. Another goal was iconography and visual grammar that's immediately legible, without explanation.",
						"First built in 2014, this was my first project after learning how to make network requests. Originally rendered as one massive SVG, with hundreds of discrete DOM elements animated with CSS transforms, I've updated it to use WebGL in Three.js and Mapbox."

						"But by using each city block as a cross section, and extruding it up to a height correlated to its density, the shape's volume naturally represents the raw count. This enabled us to communicate both statistics simultaneously, in the same visual encoding."

The map also transitions smoothly to satellite imagery at higher zoom levels, to better portray any structures and inhabitants in the affected area.",
